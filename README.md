# Folketingsvalg Danmark 2022

An app to show the results of the lastest general election in Denmark on 1 November 2022.
Mainly written in Python using the [Bokeh](https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/) library for the visualization part.
Here I have tested making a static document with all the data in the document. Hence to run the app one would 
```
python main.py
```
And then open the [`index.html`](https://carve11.github.io/folketingsvalg/) document in a browser.
